# ContractsReimagined

ContractsReimagined is a SourceMod plugin for in-game contracts. The plugin itself is the core of the contracts ecosystem. Rewards and similiar stuff are done with extention mods using the ContractsReimagined API, to combat hardcoding and better sustainability. 

Barebones README to create an idea for now.

Check the branch 'DEV' for patch notes and planned features.
